# E-commerce Backend Project with FastAPI and PostgreSQL

This is a backend-only e-commerce project built with Python and the FastAPI framework, connected to a PostgreSQL database using Docker. This project provides essential e-commerce functionalities, including user and product management, product purchasing, and updating product statuses. It was developed as a practical test of our skills with FastAPI, database management, security, and Docker configuration.

## Features

- **User Management**: Register, login, and manage users.
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for products (create, read, update, delete).
- **Purchasing Products**: API to purchase products.
- **Product Status Tracking**: View and update product statuses.
- **Secure API Endpoints**: Authentication and authorization for secure access.
